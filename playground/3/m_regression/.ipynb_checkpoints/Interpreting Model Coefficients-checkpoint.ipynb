    "### Interpreting Coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important that not only can you fit complex linear models, but that you then know which variables you can interpret. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will fit a few different models and use the quizzes below to match the appropriate interpretations to your coefficients when possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some of the cases, the coefficients of your linear regression models wouldn't be kept due to the lack of significance, that is not the aim of this notebook - **this is strictly to assure you are comfortable with how to interpret coefficients (when they are interpretable at all**."
